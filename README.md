if there are folders:
use the audios folder to place the audio files once they are done
use the visual folder to place the images, gifs and other visual stuff once they are done

you may put ALL of your stuff on the files, so that everyone can use them. those coding do NOT have to use every file on the folders. 

if there are no folders:
feel free to create them
